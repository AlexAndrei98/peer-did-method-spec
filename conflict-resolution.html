<h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>

<p>The <a href="#crdt-rules">CRDT rules</a> followed by peer DID deltas do not make conflicts impossible. However,
    they should make conflicts from non-malicious activity
    rare, and they make the order in which deltas are applied mostly uninteresting. Uncoordinated actions
    that add keys, rules, and service endpoints can never cause conflicts. Holders of keys should be able to
    operate with high autonomy and minimal coordination, even during extended periods of imperfect
    synchronization.
</p>
<p class="note">A key rotation is a bit different. It has to be treated like a deletion as far as ordering rules
    are concerned, since it does in fact include a deletion. More on this in a moment.</p>
<p>A reasonable analog might be a git repo that only allows 1 version of each file--no modifications, no
    renames--and that guarantees that independent coders never add files with the same names. Such a repo could
    probably accept commits in any order, from an unlimited number of collaborators, and largely avoid
    conflicts.
</p>
<p>The real difficulty is deletions. Suppose AcmeCorp has two agents, <code>A.1</code> and <code>A.2</code>, and
    that it uses these agents to interact with Bob, via Bob's agent <code>B.1</code>. Now imagine that <code>A.2
    </code> is hacked. <code>A.1</code> becomes suspicious and decides to take protective action. <code>A.1</code>
    creates a delta, <code>delta[1]</code>, that revokes <code>A.2</code>'s keys, and sends it to <code>B.1</code>.
    Meanwhile, the hacker on <code>A.2</code> is moving swiftly to consolidate his own advantage; he uses <code>A.2
    </code>'s leaked key to create a different delta, <code>delta[2]</code>, that revokes <code>A.1</code>'s
    keys. Each of these deltas is authorized by the very party that the other delta de-authorizes.
</p>
<p>So what does <code>B.1</code> do when it receives these contradictory deltas?
</p>

    <figcaption>Mutually contradictory deletes.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Before answering this question, let's reframe the situation into a less technical context, because it will
    make the answer easier to understand. Change AcmeCorp into a country, Acmeland, and its agents into
    diplomats that represent Acmeland in the Republic of Bob. One of the Acme diplomats becomes treasonous. Now
    the Republic of Bob receives two contradictory letters, both on official Acmeland letterhead, from A.1 and
    A.2. Each letter instructs the Republic of Bob to strip the other Acme diplomat of all rank and privileges.
</p>
<p>So what does the Republic of Bob do when it receives these contradictory letters?
</p>
<p>Part 1 of the answer is that <em>it processes them in the order it receives them</em>. If <code>A.1</code>'s
    delta arrives first, <code>A.2</code> loses rank and privileges, and the letter from <code>A.2</code> must
    be rejected. If the order changes, so does the outcome.
</p>
<p>If Acmeland is worried about this, it can prearrange with the Republic of Bob that all changes to its
    diplomat corps will always come endorsed by multiple officials. AcmeCorp can setup similar M-of-N signature
    policies in the <a>authorization</a> section of its DID doc. Wise planning can largely eliminate the
    problems with this simple first-come-first-served strategy.
</p>
<p>But let's assume that planning hasn't been perfect. And let's make the question less of a corner case. What
    if the two messages that arrive are not mutually contradictory--but one is a delete and another is an
    operation that can't succeed if the delete happens first?
</p>

    <img src="delete-order-ex.png" alt="A.1 says delete A.2; A.2 says to add a rule"/>
    <figcaption>A delete and another operation, where order matters.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Again, the party that receives these two deltas processes them in the order they are received. In a
    decentralized system, no other answer makes sense. This might feel like a terrible answer, since different
    parties can receive what started as the same sequence of deltas in very different orders, and thus end up
    with very different views of the world. But we can add a nuance that makes this feel more rational.
</p>

<p>Part 2 of the answer starts with the observation that <em>the relative order of two operations only matters
    when it affects authorization</em>. If an official for the Republic of Bob sees a letter announcing that
    Acmeland's ambassador Foo has been fired, and another letter announcing that Acmeland's ambassador Foo
    requested an appointment with Bob's prime minister, the official doesn't care about the relative order
    unless she's in charge of scheduling appointments with Bob's prime minister. Otherwise she can suspend
    judgment about whether Foo's appointment request should be honored, and wait to see how the authorization
    decision is made by someone else who's empowered to make it.
</p>

<p>The <a href="#sync-protocol">synchronization protocol</a> between parties to a DID doc allows them to have
    different opinions about order, and to adjust that order over time, based on evidence. A delete delta
    "bubbles" to a position in history that's after the last delta that would have been impossible before it,
    AND that was accepted by any party that had to make authorization decisions. A delete delta that was never
    accepted by anyone (as with one of the mutually contradictory deltas above) just disappears. And deltas that
    were discarded by a party because of ordering differences will get re-introduced to history once evidence is
    found that a party making authorization decisions saw the order differently. This is essentially like the
    Republic of Bob official saying, "For now, I'm going to pretend that Foo's appointment request is rejected,
    since I saw it after the notice that Foo was fired. But if I see that my boss has scheduled the appointment,
    I'll put the appointment request into my official log of Acmeland actions in the other order, because my
    boss must have received the letters in the other order."
</p>

<p>The net effect of these two rules for deletes is that different parties can have different views of where
    a delete fits into history, and those views will converge over time, <em>to the extent that convergence
        matters</em>. Where convergence never reaches closure, that means there's no evidence that forces one of
    the views to be more correct than the other. And that's okay.
</p>

<p>You may be saying, "Yes, but what if the ambassador was fired in the morning, and I can prove it, and
    someone still gave the ambassador privileges twelve hours later in the evening?" Or what if one party
    accepted <code>delta[0]</code>, and another party accepted <code>delta[1]</code> (that were mutually
    contradictory)? How do those get reconciled?
</p>

<p>They don't, and it doesn't matter. In the first case, the delete's timing moves to the evening in history;
    that's the true last time that the ambassador's privileges had any effect, even if the intent was to
    de-authorize earlier. The deltas are not an expression of intention, but an expression of when that intention
    was honored in any way that mattered. In the second case, the contradictory views of reality are a real
    historical event, and the fact that they caused inconsistent authorizations to happen in different corners
    of the world isn't going to be reconciled into an explanation that pretends otherwise. The deltas on top
    of the genesis doc end up containing both deletes, as well as some deltas inconsistent with both deletes.
    At least once both deletes have been applied, the potential for new inconsistencies collapses. Real life in
    a decentralized world is messy like this.
