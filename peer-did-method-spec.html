        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The Peer DID method specification conforms to the requirements specified in the DID specification
           currently published by the W3C Credentials Community Group. For more information about DIDs and
           DID method specifications, please see the <a
                    href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2017/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/did-primer.md"
                    target="_blank">DID Primer</a> and <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">DID Spec</a>.</p>
    </section>
    <section id='abstract'>
      <p>
        Most DIDs are rooted in a global or at least broadly known source of truth like a blockchain, a database, a
          distributed filesystem, or similar. This lets arbitrary parties resolve the DIDs to an endpoint and keys. It
          is an important feature for many use cases.</p>
      <p>However, the vast majority of relationships between human individuals are simpler. When Alice and Bob want to
          interact, there are exactly and only 2 parties in the world who should care: Alice and Bob. Letting the world
          resolve the identifiers and keys that only Alice and Bob care about is unnecessary, and it represents a
          privacy and security risk as well as a problem of cost, scale, and performance.</p>
      <p>This raises the possibility of DIDs that are only resolvable and usable by peers within the context of a given
          relationship. Such identifiers can still have all the other characterstics that make DIDs useful -- DID
          Documents, endpoints, and keys -- but depend on direct peer-to-peer communication instead of a shared
          source of truth.</p>
      <p>This spec defines a DID method for such "Peer DIDs". It is a method compatible with but independent of any
          particular blockchain. The protocol that communicates state, not a central store of state, is the root of
          trust. Such DIDs are not suitable for "<a
          href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gfIz5TT0cNp2kxGMLFXr19x1uoZsruUe_0glHst2fZ8/edit#heading=h.kp8mg3kwe5qz">anywise</a>"
          use cases. However, peer DIDs have certain virtues that make them uniquely desirable:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>They are essentially free to create, store, and maintain (no transaction costs).</li>
            <li>They scale and perform entirely as a function of participants, not with any central system's capacity.</li>
            <li>Because they are not persisted in any central system, there is no hacking target to protect.</li>
            <li>Because only the parties to a given relationship know them, there is no concern about personal data and
                privacy regulations due to third party data controllers or processors.</li>
            <li>Because they are not beholden to any particular blockchain, they have minimal political or technical baggage.</li>
          </ul>

      <p>We expect that peer-to-peer relationships in every blockchain ecosystem can benefit by offloading
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gfIz5TT0cNp2kxGMLFXr19x1uoZsruUe_0glHst2fZ8/edit#heading=h.eurb6x3u0443">pairwise</a>

        <h2>Peer DID Method </h2>
        <p>The namestring that shall identify this DID method is: <code>peer</code></p>
        <p>A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix: <code>did:peer</code>.
            Per the DID specification, this string MUST be in lowercase. The remainder of the DID, after the prefix,
            is the NSI specified below.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Target System(s)</h2>
        <p>This DID method applies to any relationship management implementation that is compatible with
            the <a href="https://github.com/dhh1128/indy-hipe/blob/relationship-protocol/text/peer-relationship-protocol/README.md">
                Indy HIPE on relationship protocol</a>, whether or not they have anything to do with Indy. (The
            Indy HIPE simply provided a convenient mechanism for defining foundational concepts.)
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Namespace Specific Identifier (NSI)</h2>
        <p>
          The Peer DID scheme is defined by the following <a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/std/std68.txt">ABNF</a>:<br><br>
          <code>
            peer-did      = "did:peer:idstring" *(":" subnamespace)<br>
            idstring      = 21*22(char)<br>
            subnamespace  = ALPHA *(ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" / "-")<br>
            char          = "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9" / "A" / "B" / "C"<br/>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "D" / "E" / "F" / "G" / "H" / "J" / "K" / "L" / "M" / "N" / "P" / "Q"<br/>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "R" / "S" / "T" / "U" / "V" / "W" / "X" / "Y" / "Z" / "a" / "b" / "c"<br/>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "d" / "e" / "f" / "g" / "h" / "i" / "j" / "k" / "m" / "n" / "o" / "p"<br/>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "q" / "r" / "s" / "t" / "u" / "v" / "w" / "x" / "y" / "z"<br>
          </code><br>
          All Peer DIDs are base58 encoded using the Bitcoin/IPFS alphabets of a 16-byte uuid.
          The encoding uses most alphas and digits, omitting 0OIl to avoid readability problems. This
            gives an NSI length of either 21 or 22 characters, and it means that DIDs are case-sensitive and may not
            be case-normalized, even though the prefix is always lower-case.
          </p>
        <h3>Namestring Generation Method</h3>
        <p>The 16-byte uuid underlying a Peer DID can be generated in various ways--using standard uuid methods,
            for example, or by selecting the first 16 bytes of a 256 bit Ed25519 verification key (the public
          portion of the key pair). In the latter case, there may or may not be an active verification
          key for the identity owner; that information is only available in the
          key descriptions in the owner section of the DID Document.
        </p>
        <p>A convenient regex to match <code>peer</code> DIDs is: <br><br>
            <code>^[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{21,22}$</code><br><br>
           A convenient regex to match the entire did string is:<br><br>
            <code>^did:peer:[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{21,22}(?&lt;namespace&gt;(?::\w[-\w]*)*)$</code>
        </p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p>A valid <code>peer</code> DID might be: <code>did:peer:YTEFYzByfU2RwJPyULfLLn</code>.</p>

        <h3>Create (Register)</h3>
        <p>A peer DID is created by sending a <a
                href="https://github.com/dhh1128/indy-hipe/blob/relationship-protocol/text/peer-relationship-protocol/README.md#join_us">join_us

  "view_of": [ "did:peer:qQk1twjzCmEMgLDRNmo7oS" ]
}
        </pre>

        <p>Bob's normal response, also a join_us message, would be quite similar, except that the
            <code>you</code> section would acknowledge Alice's previous message. It does this in the
            <code>you.&lt;Alice's peer DID&gt;.latest key</code> by hashing the received DID Doc
            from Alice and reporting how many versions of Alice's state Bob has seen:</p>

        <h3>Update (Replace)</h3>
        <p>The owner of a peer DID can update their associated DID Document by sending an <a
                href="https://github.com/dhh1128/indy-hipe/blob/relationship-protocol/text/peer-relationship-protocol/README.md#query_view">update_us
        </a> message to another peer:</p>

            <pre>TODO</pre>

        <h3>Delete (Revoke)</h3>
        <p>Deleting or revoking a verification key is not to be confused with temporary suspension or rotation. Deletion
            sets an identity's verification key to null; this permanently terminates the identity's ability to operate
            on the network because there is no key that the identity can use to authenticate itself--even to submit a
            new key rotation request. It is irreversible.</p>
         <p>Revocation may be appropriate
            when a person dies or a business is legally dissolved. It does not remove any record or history of the
            identity--it simply prevents any new history from accruing. This guarantees that
            no malicious actor can recover and reactivate an identity that's dead.</p>
        <p>The scope of deletion in peer DIDs is one DID only. This does not prevent an entity from creating new DIDs;
        it simply prevents an entity from reusing the old DID that has been terminated.</p>
        <p> To revoke the document of the DID, the owner of
            the DID should send a <a
                    href="https://github.com/dhh1128/indy-hipe/blob/relationship-protocol/text/peer-relationship-protocol/README.md#query_view">leave_us
