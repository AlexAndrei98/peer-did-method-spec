<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Most documentation about Decentralized Identifiers (DID) describes them as identifiers that are rooted in a public source of truth like a
    blockchain, a database, a distributed filesystem, or similar. This publicness lets arbitrary parties <a
            target="_blank" href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/">resolve</a> the DIDs to an endpoint and
    keys. It is an important feature for many use cases.</p>

<p>However, the vast majority of relationships between people, organizations, and things have simpler requirements.
    When Alice<code>(</code>Corp<code>|</code>Device<code>)</code> and Bob want to interact, there are exactly and
    only 2 parties in the world who should care: Alice and Bob. Instead of arbitrary parties needing to resolve
    their DIDs, only Alice and Bob do. Peer DIDs are perfect in these cases. In many ways, peer DIDs are to public,
    blockchain-based DIDs what <a target="cryptoc"
    href="https://education.district0x.io/general-topics/understanding-ethereum/understanding-plasma/">Ethereum Plasma</a>
    or <a target="cryptoc" href="https://education.district0x.io/general-topics/understanding-ethereum/basics-state-channels/">
    state channels</a> are to on-chain smart contracts&mdash; or what <a target="cryptoc"
    href="https://lightning.network/">Bitcoin's Lightning Network</a> is to on-chain cryptopayments. They move the bulk
    of interactions off-chain, but offer options to connect back to a chain-based ecosystem as needed. Peer DIDs create the conditions 
    for people, organizations and things to have full control of their end of the digital relationships they are engaged in.
</p>

<p>Some formal terminology may make the application of this insight to DIDs clearer:</p>

<dl>
    <dt><dfn>Anywise</dfn> DID</dt><dd>A DID intended for use with an unknowable number of parties (e.g., the global public
    or some subset thereof).</dd>
    <dt><dfn>Pairwise</dfn> DID</dt><dd>A DID intended to be known by its subject and exactly one other party (e.g., one
    usable in the Alice and Bob example just above).</dd>
    <dt><dfn>N-wise</dfn> DID</dt><dd>A DID intended to be known by exactly <em>N</em> enumerated parties including
    its subject. A business partnership with 3 members might be a modeled with n-wise DIDs. Pairwise DIDs are
    just a special case of an N-wise DID (<em>N</em> = 2). For more on n-wise DIDs, see <a href="#nwise-info">
        N-Wise in the Appendix</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Generally, an anywise DID needs to be resolvable by strangers (i.e. publicly anchored DID). These strangers can use
    the DID to reference its subject (usually by resolving it on a public ledger) without establishing a relationship.
    On the other hand, pairwise and n-wise DIDs only need to be resolvable by the parties in the relationship, and
    <em>each</em> party in the relationship has to contribute a DID to make the relationship work. Because of the
    reciprocal nature of DID usage in enumerated relationships like this, we call the parties "peers", and it is this
    dynamic that gives our DID method its name.

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <p>Peer DIDs are not suitable for <a>anywise</a> use cases, which are usually public by intent. However, peer
        DIDs have certain virtues that make them desirable for private relationships between a small number of
        enumerable parties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They have no transaction costs, making them essentially free to create, store, and maintain.</li>
        <li>They scale and perform entirely as a function of participants, not with any central system's capacity.</li>
        <li>Because they are not persisted in any central system, there is no trove to protect.</li>
        <li>Because only the parties to a given relationship know them, concerns about personal data and
            privacy regulations due to third-party data controllers or processors are much reduced.
        </li>
        <li>Because they are not beholden to any particular blockchain, they have minimal political or technical
            baggage.
        </li>
        <li>They can be mapped into the namespaces of other DID ecosystems, allowing a peer DID to have predictable
            meaning in 1 or more other blockchains (see <a href="#grafting">Grafting</a>). This creates an
            interoperability bridge and solves a problem with blockchain forks fighting over the ownership of a DID.
        </li>
        <li>Because they avoid a dependence on a central source of truth, peer DIDs free themselves of the often-online
            requirement that typifies most other DID methods. Peer DIDs can be created and maintained for an entire
            lifecycle without any reliance on the internet, with no degradation of trust. They thus align closely with
            the ethos and the architectural mindset of the <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html"

            software movements.

    <h3>Enforcement</h3>

    <p>In centralized systems, security is enforced at the center. This is so obvious that we take it for
        granted&mdash;you can't access a database unless you log in first, and it's the database that enforces
        this.
    </p>
    <p>Despite their other decentralized features, blockchains are no different in this respect. If a
        blockchain accepts updates to a DID doc, then the blockchain must guarantee that those updates are
        only made by authorized parties. Thus, most DID methods imagine a blockchain parsing the
        authorization section of a DID doc, and rejecting mischief from hackers.
    </p>
    <p>However, in a peer relationship, there IS no centralized authority. This leads to an interesting
        inversion of responsibility that must be understood: Bob enforces Alice's <a href="#authorization">
            authorization policy</a>, and Alice enforces Bob's.
    </p>
    <p>This might seem wrong&mdash;shouldn't Alice enforce her own security? But it is quite rational. Who cares
        whether the agents he is dealing with truly belong to Alice and are authorized by her? Bob does.
        And if one of Alice's agents gets hacked and attempts to subvert the Alice:Bob relationship,
        who is the uncontaminated party that can refuse to cooperate with the rogue agent? Bob is.
    </p>
    <p>Another way to think about this is that, within the Alice:Bob relationship, Bob acts as a substitute
        for a centralized resource that Alice's agents try to access. In such a mental model, of course, Bob
        would be a logical place to enforce access rules for Alice.
