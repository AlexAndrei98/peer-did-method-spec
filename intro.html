<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Most documentation about DIDs describes them as identifiers that are rooted in a public source of truth like a
    blockchain, a database, a distributed filesystem, or similar. This publicness lets arbitrary parties <a
            target="_blank" href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/">resolve</a> the DIDs to an endpoint and
    keys. It is an important feature for many use cases.</p>

<p>However, the vast majority of relationships between people, organizations, and things have simpler requirements.
    When Alice<code>(</code>Corp<code>|</code>Device<code>)</code> and Bob want to interact, there are exactly and
    only 2 parties in the world who should care: Alice and Bob. Instead of arbitrary parties needing to resolve
    their DIDs, only Alice and Bob do.</p>

<p>Some formal terminology may make the application of this insight to DIDs clearer:</p>

<dl>
    <dt><dfn>Anywise</dfn> DID</dt><dd>A DID intended for use with an unknowable number of parties (e.g., the global public
    or some subset thereof).</dd>
    <dt><dfn>Pairwise</dfn> DID</dt><dd>A DID intended to be known by its subject and exactly one other party (e.g., one
    usable in the Alice and Bob example just above).</dd>
    <dt><dfn>N-wise</dfn> DID</dt><dd>A DID intended to be known by exactly <em>N</em> enumerated parties including
    its subject. A business partnership with 3 members might be a modeled with n-wise DIDs. Pairwise DIDs are
    just a special case of an N-wise DID (<em>N</em> = 2). For more on n-wise DIDs, see <a href="#nwise-info">
        N-Wise in the Appendix</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Generally, an anywise DID needs to be resolvable by strangers. These strangers can use the DID to reference its
    subject without establishing a relationship. On the other hand, pairwise and n-wise DIDs only need to be
    resolvable by the parties in the relationship, and <em>each</em> party in the relationship has to contribute a
    DID to make the relationship work. Because of the reciprocal nature of DID usage in enumerated relationships
    like this, we call the parties "peers", and it is this dynamic that gives our DID method its name.

    <h3>Guarantees</h3>
    <p>This spec uses a <a target="aries"
            href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0003-protocols/README.md#what-is-a-protocol">
        protocol</a>, rather than a public oracle, as the root of trust. This protocol reliably communicates data
        about peer DIDs and peer DID docs; peers must persist that data into a local cache or database that functions
        as the <a target="didspec" href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#dfn-dir">Decentralized Identifier
            Registry</a> for the method. The method is worthy of trust because it guarantees the following properties:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>DIDs are associated with at least one key pair at the moment of creation.</dt>
        <dd>This prevents a category of man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker could rotate a DID's keys
            at the outset of a relationship, unbeknownst to peers.
        </dd>
        <dt>DIDs have an acceptable level of uniqueness.</dt>
        <dd>This is NOT a guarantee that DIDs will never be reused by their owner, NOR is it a guarantee that
            collusion cannot subvert uniqueness. Thus, it is not a uniqueness upon which deep trust can be based.
            Rather, it is a guarantee that good behavior will not produce accidental collisions. In this
            sense, it is a bit like the uniqueness offered by NATing mechanisms in IPv4. It provides
            enough uniqueness that a DID can be used as an index in a database or as a routing target
            in DID communication. It also makes it possible for blockchains to <a href="#grafting">graft</a> a peer
            DID by mapping it into their namespace, without incurring the risk of ambiguity. Any time a peer
            DID is discovered to be less than unique, a true problem exists and systems can fairly
            raise an exception.
        </dd>
        <dt>The values of DIDs are securely random.</dt>
        <dd>This prevents attackers from discovering patterns in DIDs that might undermine privacy.
        </dd>
        <dt>Parties to a relationship can prove the orderly and authorized evolution of their
            keys to one another.</dt>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <p>Peer DIDs are not suitable for <a>anywise</a> use cases, which are usually public by intent. However, peer
        DIDs have certain virtues that make them desirable for private relationships between a small number of
        enumerable parties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They have no transaction costs, making them essentially free to create, store, and maintain.</li>
        <li>They scale and perform entirely as a function of participants, not with any central system's capacity.</li>
        <li>Because they are not persisted in any central system, there is no trove to protect.</li>
        <li>Because only the parties to a given relationship know them, there is no concern about personal data and
            privacy regulations due to third-party data controllers or processors.
        </li>
        <li>Because they are not beholden to any particular blockchain, they have minimal political or technical
            baggage.
        </li>
        <li>They can be mapped into the namespaces of other DID ecosystems, allowing a peer DID to have
            predictable meaning in 1 or more other blockchains. This solves a problem with blockchain forks
            fighting over the ownership of a DID and promotes interoperability.
        </li>
        <li>Because they avoid a dependence on a central source of truth, peer DIDs free themselves of the often-online
            requirement that typifies most other DID methods. Peer DIDs can be created and maintained for an entire
            lifecycle without any reliance on the internet, with no degradation of trust. They thus align closely with
            the ethos and the architectural mindset of the <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html"

    <h3>Comparison to Other DID Methods</h3>
    <p>We could certainly build peer relationships with <a>anywise</a> DIDs based on a public ledger or a similar
        source of truth. However, in the same way that a company doesn't want the public to resolve private host
        names inside its corporate intranet, letting others resolve <a>pairwise</a> and <a>n-wise</a> DIDs is
        unnecessary, and it represents a privacy and security risk as well as a problem of cost, scale, and
        performance. We strongly recommend that peer DIDs be used for peer relationships.
    </p>
    <p>In a similar vein, peer DIDs could be used, hypothetically, for <a>anywise</a> scenarios. The main
        disadvantage would be the lack of a formal publication mechanism. Nothing would prevent a user from
        publishing a peer DID and its associated DID document on some website, but such publication would be hard to
        discover, maintain as DID docs evolved, and integrate into interoperable applications. DID methods that use
        a public ledger or a similar source of truth are a better choice here, because they have authoritative
        answers to the publication problem.

    <h3>Applicability in Group Relationships</h3>
    <p>Most of this doc is framed by a <a>pairwise</a> Alice:Bob context. This sort of pair (no matter whether its
        members are people, IoT devices, or institutions) will be the most common peer relationship in the SSI
        landscape. Groups larger than 2 can also have a peer-style relationship&mdash;but not all groups will be
        modeled that way. Therefore, applying this method to groups should be done thoughtfully.</p>
    <p>Some groups, such as a doctor, a hospital, and a patient participating in a medical procedure together, are
        <a href="nwise.html#sweet-spot">clearly n-wise</a>. Each party can enumerate all the other parties, and each
        party uses the same identifier in all directions within the group:
    </p>
    <img src="n-wise.png"/>
    <p>(See <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0006-ssi-notation/README.md"
            target="aries">Aries RFC 0006</a> for help with the notation used in the diagram.)</p>
    <p>But groups can also be modeled with a hub-and-spoke model. That model is commonly used in group chats,
        for example: each member of the group chat sends and receives via a central service, which in turn
        broadcasts to all other members of the group. This hub-and-spoke model is actually just a <a>pairwise</a>
        variant, because the relationship is between a member and the hub; all other relationships are only
        indirect:</p>
    <img src="hub-wise.png"/>
    <p>Use of peer DIDs with <a>n-wise</a> groups is explicitly supported and documented below. We do not cover
        hub-and-spoke groups in the same way. They are compatible with this method, if reanalyzed as
        <a>pairwise</a>. Otherwise, the protocol described here may need adaptation.</p>

    <h3>Enforcement</h3>

    <p>In centralized systems, security is enforced at the center. This is so obvious that we take it for
        granted&mdash;you can't access a database unless you log in first, and it's the database that enforces
        this.
    </p>
    <p>Despite their other decentralized features, blockchains are no different in this respect. If a
        blockchain accepts updates to a DID doc, then the blockchain must guarantee that those updates are
        only made by authorized parties. Thus, most DID methods imagine a blockchain parsing the
        authorization section of a DID doc, and rejecting mischief from hackers.
    </p>
    <p>However, in a peer relationship, there IS no centralized authority. This leads to an interesting
        inversion of responsibility that must be understood: Bob enforces Alice's <a href="#authorization">
            authorization policy</a>, and Alice enforces Bob's.
    </p>
    <p>This might seem wrong&mdash;shouldn't Alice enforce her own security? But it is quite rational. Who cares
        whether the agents he is dealing with truly belong to Alice and are authorized by her? Bob does.
        And if one of Alice's agents gets hacked and attempts to subvert the Alice:Bob relationship,
        who is the uncontaminated party that can refuse to cooperate with the rogue agent? Bob is.
    </p>
    <p>Another way to think about this is that, within the Alice:Bob relationship, Bob acts as a substitute
        for a centralized resource that Alice's agents try to access. In such a mental model, of course, Bob
        would be a logical place to enforce access rules for Alice.
