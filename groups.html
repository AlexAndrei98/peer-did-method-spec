<h1>N-Wise</h1>

<p>N-wise groups often exist alongside pairwise relationships. For example, a 3-wise business
    partnership between Alice, Bob, and Carol is probably preceded by pairwise relationships between
    each of the parties. When the business is founded, a new 3-wise relationship is created, with the
    parties allocating new DIDs, keys, and DID docs to this relationship independent of the ones
    they use in their pairwise friendships. This keeps business and personal relationships separate.
    If a new partner is added, the 3-wise relationship can become 4-wise; if a partner dies, the
    partnership can lose an active participant, but continue to recognize that party in the
    relationship history. This shows the close affinity but also the separation between pairwise and
    n-wise. For more details, see <a target="_blank"

    <h2>Features</h2>

    <p>When N is greater than 2, N-wise DIDs provide the following benefits over combinations of pairwise DIDs:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Single signature</dt>
        <dd>Group member X can sign something once, and all members of the group (plus outside parties who learn X's
            public key) will agree that DID X signed it. In pairwise, you would have to sign once for each pairwise
            DID that will have to inspect the signature. Alternatively, you could solve this with a public (non-peer)
            DID. You could also solve this with a hub-and-spoke model, where each party has a pairwise relationship
            to the hub, and the hub attests to the validity of the signature. However, that requires all the group
            members to trust the hub. It is a form of centralization that is contrary to the ethos of peers.
        </dd>
        <dt>Multiplexed authenticated encryption</dt>
        <dd>
            Group member X can encrypt only once, and all members of the group can decrypt it, can know that X was
            the sender, and can know that it hasn't been tampered with. Note that this is distinct from signing, and
            is usually used instead of signing. It is repudiable outside the group, meaning that although the group
            knows the sender, it cannot prove to an outside auditor that X was the sender. In pairwise, you would
            have to encrypt once for each pairwise DID. For small messages, this would not be terrible, but if the
            message includes a massive payload or if the transport is expensive (e.g. dead drop on a blockchain or
            physically painted on a public wall), it would be unfortunate. This problem cannot be solved with an
            anywise DID, because an anywise DID only lets the world encrypt to you (inbound); it doesn't let you
            encrypt to the world (outbound). A weak form of this can be done in the hub-and-spoke model of groups.
            You encrypt for the hub and ask the hub to re-encrypt for all other parties. However, the hub sees the
            message as plaintext, which is a security problem.
        </dd>
        <dt>Multicast</dt>
        <dd>Once multiplex-encrypted, message can be broadcast or left at a shared location instead of transmitting
            point-to-point. Not possible in pairwise; each transmission uses a separate channel. Not possible with
            anywise. In hub-and-spoke groups, the sender doesn't have to worry about the rebroadcast, but the hub
            still has to send to each recipient individually. There is no true multicast.
        </dd>
        <dt>Ease of reference</dt>
        <dd>All parties in the relationship can refer to the other parties in the relationship by the same DID.
            If the group is modeled only as a mesh of pairwise relationships, this becomes a genuine problem. It is
            challenging for Alice and Bob to refer to Carol in a way that both talkers are guaranteed to understand
            without coordination. (To be precise, although it may be easy for humans to use fuzzy labels, it is
            challenging for software agents to do so. When agents for such people engage in protocols, they need
            precision as they refer to one another, index databases by one another's identifiers, route messages,
            and so forth.) Correlation can be done via credentials, but there is no guarantee that such credentials
            have been shared in the same way with all other parties--and even if they have, the correlating data may
            be packaged in an infinite variety of ways, requiring arbitrary storage complexity. By providing a
            handle by which all members of the group refer to Carol in the same terse way, Carol is allowed to prove
            whatever she wants, when she wants, to whoever she wants--but still to be recognized simply within the
            group as the same person.

    <p>
        Flat (not strongly hierarchical) groups with a small, enumerated set of members, and without a centralizing
        party that must act as coordinator and dispatcher. Many of the members probably have pairwise relationships
        with one another, separate from the group relationship--but the group has important coordination needs as a
        group, as well. Members of the group want to be correlated the same way to all other members in that group
        context.

    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Families (parents and siblings to one another)</li>
        <li>A book group</li>
        <li>A small unit of military commandos on a special mission</li>
        <li>A group of threatened journalists</li>
        <li>A corporate board</li>
        <li>A business partnership</li>
        <li>A team of lawyers defending a single client</li>
        <li>Investigators jointly assigned to a case</li>
        <li>Academic researchers collaborating to publish an article</li>
        <li>Drones coordinating to lift a heavy object together</li>
        <li>Doctor + hospital + patient trying to arrange a procedure involving all 3</li>
        <li>An appellate court with 5 or 7 judges</li>
        <li>Study groups in college</li>
        <li>Developers collaborating on a codebase</li>

    <h2>Where n-wise is suboptimal</h2>
    <p>Large groups. Groups with a centralizing party that always or almost always acts as coordinator and
        dispatcher. Groups where most members do not know one another and would rarely interact except with the
        group as a whole. Groups where members don't want to be known to one another.
    </p>

    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A teacher and a class of 100 students (too many; teacher centralizes; most interactions are between
            teacher and student, not between students)</li>
        <li>An auction with sealed bids (auctioneer centralizes; parties wish to remain anonymous to one another)</li>
        <li>A gamer in an online game with N other players (easier to centralize than to have gamers communicate
            directly to one another, and need for security isn't high)</li>
        <li>A captain in the military to several lieutenants and the various units they each command (hierarchical;
            too many)</li>
        <li>A global fan club for a major celebrity</li>
        <li>The hacker group "anonymous" (n-wise discloses too much; they'd prefer to limit how much is known about
            the group by any one person, so they want just a network of pairwise)</li>
