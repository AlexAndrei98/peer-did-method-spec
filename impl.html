    <h2>Levels of Support</h2>

    <p>Different software may need to support peer DIDs to different degrees. Some natural clusters of functionality
        include:

    <dl>
        <dt>Level 1: Recognize</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Software with <dfn>Level 1</dfn> support MUST understand what a peer DID is and how it works. It MUST
                tell whether a string is a valid peer DID or not. It MUST correctly compare two peer DIDs when sorting
                or testing for equality, taking into account the case sensitivity rules. If relevant, it SHOULD display,
                hyphenate, and abbreviate peer DIDs correctly. See <a href="#recognizing-and-handling-peer-dids">
                Recognizing and handling peer DIDs</a>.
            </p>
            <p>This might be an appropriate level of support for a database that needs to store peer DIDs as an
                indexed field, but that otherwise has little need to provide peer DID features.
            </p>
            <p><em>Expected effort</em>: a few minutes of coder time. See the <a href="#matching-regex">matching regex
                </a> and the <a href="#js-compare-func">JavaScript implementation of correct comparison semantics</a>.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Level 2a: Accept static peer DIDs from others</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Software with <dfn>Level 2a</dfn> support includes <a>Level 1</a> support, and is also willing to
                interact with other parties that use peer DIDs (e.g., to perform a <a target="aries"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0023-did-exchange/README.md">DID
                Exchange</a> and additional protocols)--as long as the other parties do not attempt to update their DID
                docs. This "static" (no update) constraint drastically simplifies implementation because support for
                <a>backing storage</a>, <a>deltas</a>, and the <a target="aries"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0030-sync-connection/README.md">
                Sync Connection</a> or <a target="aries"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0030-sync-connection/query-connection-state-protocol/README.md">
                Query Connection State</a> protocols is NOT REQUIRED. The implementation MUST recognize peer DIDs (Level
                1), MUST store peer DID docs, and MUST look up those docs as a form of resolution. The implementation
                SHOULD handle an <a target="aries"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0030-sync-connection/abandon-connection-protocol/README.md">
                <code>abandon_connect/announce</code> message</a> gracefully, deleting the peer DID Doc from its cache.
                The implementation MUST return a
                <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0035-report-problem/README.md"
                target="aries"><code>problem_report</code></a> with <code>code</code> == <code>unsupported-protocol</code>
                if a remote party attempts to use dynamic peer DID protocols. The implementation SHOULD report that it
                supports the DID Exchange protocol if it receives a <a target="aries"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0031-discover-features/README.md">
                <code>discover-features/query</code> message</a>.

            </p>
            <p>This might be a beginning level of support for software that's already supporting other DID methods,
            that wants meaningful interoperability as quickly and cheaply as possible. However, it is NOT RECOMMENDED
            as a permanent goal, because it places limits on the behaviors of other peer DID users. Upgrading to
            <a>Level 3a</a> support is strongly preferred.
            </p>
            <p><em>Expected effort</em>: a few hours of coder time if a codebase already has some DID features, or a
                couple days of effort if starting from scratch.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Level 2b: Give static peer DIDs to others</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Software with <dfn>Level 2b</dfn> support includes <a>Level 1</a> support. It also creates peer DIDs and
                gives them to other parties as the basis of interactions. <a>Level 2a</a> and Level 2b are not
                hierarchical; either or both may be chosen, and the effort to implement is somewhat independent.
            </p>
            <p>Like <a>Level 2a</a>, Level 2b gets significant compatibility because the effort of supporting
                <a>backing storage</a>, <a>deltas</a>, and the <a target="aries"

                    Query Connection State</a> protocols is NOT REQUIRED. Resolving peer DIDs against a cached version
                of a peer DID Doc is also NOT REQUIRED. However, Level 2b-compliant implementations MUST be capable of
                generating a genesis version of their own DID doc and calculating the <a>numeric basis</a> and DID
                value that goes with it. The implementation SHOULD receive and MAY emit an <a target="aries"

                    <code>abandon_connect/announce</code> message</a> gracefully.

                if a remote party attempts to use dynamic peer DID protocols. The implementation SHOULD report that it

            </p>
            <p>This might be an appropriate level of support for software that wants to use peer DIDs, but doesn't
                intend to ever rotate its keys.
            </p>
            <p class="note" id="static-and-key-rotation">
                Key rotation is an important security feature. It is generally a bad idea to provide no way to change
                how proof of control is provided. The wisdom of supporting neither key rotation NOR <a target="aries"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0030-sync-connection/abandon-connection-protocol/README.md">
                a way to abandon a connection</a> is particularly dubious. However, these static-only levels of support
                are provided anyway, because some connections might be so short-lived that the security risks are
                acceptable. Use good judgment. [[TODO: Do we need to support expiration of a conn?]]
            </p>
            <p><em>Expected effort</em>: a few hours of coder time if a codebase already has some DID features--especially
                <a>Level 2a</a> support--or a couple days of effort if starting from scratch.

        </dd>
        <dt>Level 3a: Accept dynamic peer DIDs from others</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Software with <dfn>Level 3a</dfn> support includes <a>Level 2a</a> support and is maximally interoperable
                with others who want to use peer DIDs in rich ways. It may or may not use any peer DIDs of its own.
            </p>
            <p>Such an implementation MUST provide<a>backing storage</a> to persist others' peer DID Docs and the
                <a>deltas</a> for them. It MUST support the <a target="aries"

                Sync Connection</a> and <a target="aries"

                Query Connection State</a> protocols, but, if <a>Level 3b</a> is supported, it can support those protocols
                only for the dynamic data of others (meaning the only role it has to support in Query Connection State
                is <code>responder</code>). The implementation SHOULD report that it supports these protocols if it
                receives a relevant <a target="aries"

            </p>
            <p>This level of support for accepting peer DIDs is RECOMMENDED for software that wants to offer rich peer
                DID support to others, regardless of the level of peer DID usage it intends for itself. Anything less
                than this level of support, insofar as <em>accepting</em> DIDs from others is concerned, in software
                that expects to interact richly on the DID landscape, will hamper pervasive interoperability.

    <h2>Encryption Envelope</h2>

    <p>The encryption envelope for DID Communication has three independent implementations&mdash;one in
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/fbad7422/libindy/src/api/crypto.rs#L634">
    libindy</a>, one in <a target="_blank"
    href="https://github.com/bcgov/indy-catalyst/blob/bba2ef5c/agent/indy_catalyst_agent/wallet/crypto.py#L402">
    python with no Indy dependencies</a>, and one in <a target="_blank"
    href="https://github.com/dbluhm/indy-pack-unpack-js/blob/db9d83e4/index.js">
    javascript with no Indy dependencies</a>.
    </p>

    <p>The connection protocol that creates and registers peer DIDs, including support for DID resolution
    after forming a connection, has been fully implemented by
    half a dozen different organizations, as of March 2019. One of these organizations did not use
    libindy. The connection management protocols that allow update of DIDs are in various states of
    implementation. An up-to-date summary of implementation status, including links to the implementations,
    can be found in the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent">indy-agent repo on github</a>.
    </p>

    <p>There is a formal test suite for the protocols as well, in the same github repo.
