    <h3>Levels of Support</h3>

    <p>Different software may need to support peer DIDs to different degrees. Some natural clusters of functionality
        include:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Level 1: Recognition</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Software understands what a peer DID is and how it works. It can tell whether a string is a valid
                peer DID or not. It correctly compares two peer DIDs when sorting or testing for equality, taking
                into account the case sensitivity rules.</p>
            <p>This might be an appropriate level of support for a database that needs to store peer DIDs as an
                indexed field, but that otherwise has little </p>

    <h3>Encryption Envelope</h3>

    <p>The encryption envelope for DID Communication has three independent implementations&mdash;one in
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/fbad7422/libindy/src/api/crypto.rs#L634">
    libindy</a>, one in <a target="_blank"
    href="https://github.com/bcgov/indy-catalyst/blob/bba2ef5c/agent/indy_catalyst_agent/wallet/crypto.py#L402">
    python with no Indy dependencies</a>, and one in <a target="_blank"
    href="https://github.com/dbluhm/indy-pack-unpack-js/blob/db9d83e4/index.js">
    javascript with no Indy dependencies</a>.
    </p>

    <p>The connection protocol that creates and registers peer DIDs, including support for DID resolution
    after forming a connection, has been fully implemented by
    half a dozen different organizations, as of March 2019. One of these organizations did not use
    libindy. The connection management protocols that allow update of DIDs are in various states of
    implementation. An up-to-date summary of implementation status, including links to the implementations,
    can be found in the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent">indy-agent repo on github</a>.
    </p>

    <p>There is a formal test suite for the protocols as well, in the same github repo.
