    <h3>Comparison to Other DID Methods</h3>
    <p>We could certainly build peer relationships with <a>anywise</a> DIDs based on a public ledger or a similar
        source of truth. However, in the same way that a company doesn't want the public to resolve private host
        names inside its corporate intranet, letting others resolve <a>pairwise</a> and <a>n-wise</a> DIDs is
        unnecessary, and it represents a privacy and security risk as well as a problem of cost, scale, and
        performance. We strongly recommend that peer DIDs be used for peer relationships.
    </p>
    <p>In a similar vein, peer DIDs could be used, hypothetically, for <a>anywise</a> scenarios. The main disadvantage
        would be the lack of a formal publication mechanism. Nothing would prevent a user from publishing a peer DID and
        its associated DID document on a website. However, information published in this way would be hard to discover,
        maintain as DID docs evolved, and integrate into interoperable applications. DID methods that use
        a public ledger or a similar source of truth are a better choice here, because they have authoritative
        answers to the publication problem.
