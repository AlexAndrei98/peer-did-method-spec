        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#specific-did-method-schemes">DID method spec</a> conforms
            to the requirements in the DID specification currently published by the W3C Credentials Community Group.
            For more information about DIDs and DID method specifications, please see the <a
                    href="http://bit.ly/2RX0xm2" target="_blank">DID Primer</a>

    <section id='abstract'>
        <p>This document defines a "peer" <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#specific-did-method-schemes">DID Method</a>
            that can be used independent of any central source of truth. The method is cheap, fast, scalable,
            and secure. It is suitable for most private relationships between people, organizations, and IoT things.
            DIDs associated with this method are also promotable to a more public context. That is, blockchains with
            different DID methods can graft some or all peer DIDs into their namespace(s) with no risk of accidental
            collision, and no loss of meaning. Peer DID will have a recognizable and consistent identity in all of them.

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Most introductions to DIDs describe them as identifiers that are rooted in a public source of truth like a
        blockchain, a database, a distributed filesystem, or similar. This publicness lets arbitrary parties resolve
        the DIDs to an endpoint and keys. It is an important feature for many use cases.</p>
        <p>However, the vast majority of relationships between people, organizations, and IoT things are simpler. When
            Alice(Corp|Device) and Bob want to interact, there are exactly and only 2 parties in the world who should
            care: Alice and Bob. We call these parties "peers" because there is an equality rather than a hierarchy
            to them, at least insofar as their DID management is concerned. Letting the world resolve the identifiers
            and keys that only peers care about is unnecessary, and it represents a privacy and security risk as well
            as a problem of cost, scale, and performance.</p>
        <section>
            <h2>Pairwise, N-wise</h2>
            <p>This raises the possibility of DIDs that are only resolvable and usable by peers within the context of a
                given relationship. Such <a href="http://bit.ly/2BhEPC2">pairwise</a> or <a href="http://bit.ly/2Qr2BGc">
                n-wise</a> identifiers can still have all the other characterstics that make DIDs useful -- DID
                Documents, endpoints, keys, authorizations, interoperability, and tooling.</p>
            <section>
            <h3>Guarantees</h3>
                <p>This spec uses a protocol, rather than a public oracle, as the root of trust. It is worthy
                    of trust because it guarantees the following properties:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><em>DIDs are associated with a key pair at the moment of creation</em>. This prevents a
                    category of man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker could rotate a DID's keys
                    at the outset of a relationship unbeknownst to peers.</li>
                <li><em>DIDs are forced to be globally unique.</em> This prevents accidental collisions when
                    identity owners store many peer DIDs in their wallets. It also makes it possible for blockchains
                    to "adopt" a peer DID by mapping it into their namespace, without incurring the risk of collision.</li>
                <li><em>DID values are securely random.</em> This prevents attackers from discovering patterns
                    in DID values that might undermine privacy.</li>
                <li><em>Parties to a relationship can prove the orderly and authorized evolution of their
                    keys to one another.</em></li>
            </ol>
            </section>
            <section>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
                <p>Peer DIDs are not suitable for <a href="http://bit.ly/2SNaXVB">anywise</a> use cases, which are <a
                        href="http://bit.ly/2GaYWHN">usually public by intent</a>. However, peer DIDs have certain
                    virtues that make them desirable for private relationships between a small number of enumerable parties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They have no transaction costs, making them essentially free to create, store, and maintain.</li>
                <li>They scale and perform entirely as a function of participants, not with any central system's capacity.</li>
                <li>Because they are not persisted in any central system, there is no trove to protect.</li>
                <li>Because only the parties to a given relationship know them, there is no concern about personal data and
                    privacy regulations due to third party data controllers or processors.</li>
                <li>Because they are not beholden to any particular blockchain, they have minimal political or technical
                    baggage.</li>
                <li>They can be mapped into the namespaces of other DID ecosystems, allowing a peer DID to have
                predictable meaning in 1 or more other blockchains. This solves a problem with blockchain forks
                fighting over the ownership of a DID, and promotes interoperability.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>Groups</h2>
            <p>Most of this doc is framed by a pairwise Alice:Bob context. This sort of pair (no matter whether its
            members are people, IoT devices, or institutions) will be the most common peer relationship in the SSI
            landscape. Groups larger than 2 can also have a peer-style relationship--but not all groups will be
            modeled that way. Therefore, applying this method to groups should be done thoughtfully.</p>

            <p>Some groups, such as Doctor+Hospital+Patient, are clearly n-wise. Each party can enumerate all the
                other parties, and each party uses the same identifier in all directions within the group. N-wise
                groups are peer groups by definition: (see <a target="_blank"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/master/text/0014-ssi-notation/README.md">Indy
                    HIPE 0014</a> for help on the SSI notation used in this diagram).</p>
            <img src="n-wise.png"/>
            <p>But groups can also be modeled with a hub-and-spoke model. That model is commonly used in group chats, for example: each member of the group chat sends and receives via a central service, which in turn broadcasts to all other members of the group. This hub-and-spoke model is actually just a pairwise variant, because the relationship is between a member and the hub; all other relationships are only indirect:</p>
            <img src="hub-wise.png"/>
            <p>We do not cover hub-and-spoke groups explicitly below. They are compatible with this method, if reanalyzed as pairwise. Otherwise, the protocol may need adaptation.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Enforcement</h2>

            <p>In centralized systems, security is enforced at the center. This is so obvious that we take it for
                granted--you can't access a database unless you log in first, and it's the database that enforces this.</p>

            <p>Despite their other decentralized features, blockchains are no different in this respect. If a
                blockchain accepts updates to a DID Doc, then the blockchain must guarantee that those updates are
                only made by authorized parties. Thus, most DID methods imagine a blockchain parsing the
                authorization section of a DID Doc, and rejecting mischief from hackers.</p>

            <p>However, in a peer relationship, there IS no centralized authority. This leads to an interesting
                inversion of responsibility that must be understood: Bob enforces Alice's authorization policy,
                and Alice enforces Bob's.</p>

            <p>This might seem wrong--shouldn't Alice enforce her own security? But it is quite rational. Who cares
                whether the agents he is dealing with truly belong to Alice and are authorized by her? Bob does.
                And if one of Alice's agents gets hacked and attempts to subvert the Alice:Bob relationship,
                who is the uncontaminated party that can refuse to cooperate with the rogue agent? Bob is.</p>

            <p>Another way to think about this is that, within the Alice:Bob relationship, Bob acts as a substitute
                for a centralized resource that Alice's agents try to access. In such a mental model, of course Bob
                would be a logical place to enforce access rules for Alice.</p>
        </section>

        <p>We expect that peer-to-peer relationships in every blockchain ecosystem can benefit by offloading pairwise
            and n-wise relationships to peer DIDs.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Characteristics</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Namestring</h3>
            <p>The namestring that shall identify this DID method is: <code>peer</code></p>
            <p>A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix: <code>did:peer</code>.
                Per the DID specification, this string MUST be in lowercase. The remainder of the DID, after the prefix,
                is the NSI specified below.</p>
            <p>Early feedback on this method suggested that we embed it beneath the namespace of a particular blockchain,
            as in <code>did:sov:peer</code> or <a
            target="_blank" href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-veres-one/#veres-one-did-format"><code>did:v1:nym</code></a>.
            However, this DID method is not captive to any particular blockchain, does not take its resolution rules
            from a parent method, and does not require anchoring or reference to a blockchain to be valid.
            Furthermore, any direct or indirect anchoring of a peer DID to a specific blockchain is driven by
            circumstance and changeable at any time. For example, a peer DID could specify that it is using
            a dead drop on blockchain 1, then change to blockchain 2, then change to blockchains 3 and 4 at
            the same time. Therefore, "peer" belongs at the top of the DID namespace. How this method may be
            used in conjunction with various blockchains is discussed <a href="#cross-registration">later</a>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Target System(s)</h3>
            <p>This DID method applies to any identity management implementation that meets the following two
                requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Cryptonyms</em> -- The DIDs are created using the <a href="#gen_method">algorithm described below</a>,
                    endowing them with properties vital for trust that is not dependent on a central source of truth.</li>
                <li><em>Protocol</em> -- The metadata for DIDs (what would be stored in an on-chain DID Doc in other methods)
                is communicated as described below.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Namespace Specific Identifier (NSI)</h3>
            <p><a name="gen_method"></a>
              The Peer DID scheme is defined by the following <a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/std/std68.txt">ABNF</a>:<br><br>
              <code>
                peer-did      = "did:peer:" keyfmtchar ":" idstring<br>
                keyfmtchar    = "1"<br>
                idstring      = 21*22base58char<br>
                base58char    = "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9" / "A" / "B" / "C"<br/>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "D" / "E" / "F" / "G" / "H" / "J" / "K" / "L" / "M" / "N" / "P" / "Q"<br/>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "R" / "S" / "T" / "U" / "V" / "W" / "X" / "Y" / "Z" / "a" / "b" / "c"<br/>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "d" / "e" / "f" / "g" / "h" / "i" / "j" / "k" / "m" / "n" / "o" / "p"<br/>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "q" / "r" / "s" / "t" / "u" / "v" / "w" / "x" / "y" / "z"<br>
              </code><br>
              All Peer DIDs are base58 encoded values. The underlying number represented in base58 is a cryptographic
              public key or a derivative (e.g., hash) thereof, as determined by <code>keyfmtchar</code>. At the time of this writing, only
                one <code>keyfmtchar</code> is defined. This is "1", denoting a format where <code>idstring</code> is the
                upper 16 bytes of an Ed25519 public key. This gives <code>idstring</code> a length of either 21 or 22
                base58 characters. This spec may be updated to include other <code>keyfmtchar</code> variants for
                SecP256, Curve448, or similar. Such updates might change the length of <code>idstring</code> as well.</p>
            <p>The encoding of <code>idstring</code> uses most alphas and digits, omitting 0 (zero), O (capital o),
                I (capital i), and l (lower L) to avoid readability problems. Regardless of the length of <code>idstring</code>,
                peer DIDs are case-sensitive and may not be case-normalized, even though the prefix is always lower-case.
              </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Namestring Generation Method</h3>
            <p>The unique numeric value underlying a Peer DID MUST be generated by using a cryptographically robust
                algorithm with secure randomness to create an Ed25519 keypair (or, when additional formats are supported,
                an analogous keypair on a different curve), and then selecting as the NSI a subset of the public
                verification key that is at least 128 bits, and that is dependent on <code>keyfmtchar</code>. For
                <code>keyfmtchar</code> = "1", the NSI = the most significant 16 bytes of the public verification key.</p>
            <p>In this way, the DID can be known to begin its existence already associated with keys, and the owner
                of the new DID is guaranteed to be the only entity in the world who possesses the private key.
                This guarantees the initial integrity of the DID's chain of custody.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p>A convenient regex to match <code>peer</code> DIDs is: <br><br>
                <code>^did:peer:1:[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{21,22}$</code>.
            </p>
            <p>A valid <code>peer</code> DID might be: <code>did:peer:1:YTEFYzByfU2RwJPyULfLLn</code>.</p>
        </section>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Protocol</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Roles</h3>

            <p>We call this the "peer" DID method because it enables peers--parties with no relative hierarchy--to
                exchange DIDs without recourse to a central authority. Thus, we expect only one role in our
                protocol: <code>peer</code>. And this is the case, at a high level.</p>

            <p>However, at another level of detail, each peer may interact through various pieces of software
                and hardware that proxy them. They may need to reveal a modest amount of information about such agents to
                achieve cooperative security. For example, Alice may control 3 devices, and may wish to protect
                herself from hacking by saying that at least 2 of her existing devices must agree before a new
                device can be added or an existing device can be revoked. This requires her to share her M-of-N
                policy with Bob, with enough information about agent keys that he can validate a multi-party
                digital signature. Thus, our protocol must occasionally contemplate details about this more
                granular level of each peer's <a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2QP9GzQ">sovereign domain</a>.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Messages</h3>

            <p><em>Peers interact via messages</em>. This is a more general claim than saying that peers expose an API,
                because it doesn't assume that peers are directly callable by each other. It must be possible to
                exchange DIDs in this method in a very asynchronous fashion (e.g., one party sends a message while the
                other party is offline; a response is returned when the original sender may not be actively listening).</p>
            <p><em>Message transmission is transport-agnostic</em>. That is, the messages can flow over any combination
                of http, bluetooth, NFC, email, AMPRNet (TCP/IP over ham radio), snail mail, sneakernet, intermediaries,
                or future protocols we have not yet invented.</p>
            <p><em>Messages are <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259">JSON</a></em>. They are
                compatible with <a target="_blank" href="https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#basic-concepts">basic
                concepts of JSON-LD</a>, but no deep knowledge of JSON-LD is required to understand them, and no dependency
                on JSON-LD libraries is necessary. The specifics of JSON format are discussed below.</p>
            <p><em>Messages are serialized and encrypted</em> in a standard way for transport. This method associates
                security guarantees with the message envelope rather than the transport, and is aligned philosophically with
                the approach of <a target="_blank" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/">IETF's Message
                Level Security initiative</a>. However, the first version of this spec predates MLS's maturity, so
                the wire format uses <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7516.txt">JWEs</a>
                with some extensions, instead. The particulars are detailed in <a target="_blank"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/master/text/0028-wire-message-format/README.md">
                an Indy HIPE</a>. The format is as close as we could get to JWE</a> conformance, but
                includes some extensions to handle multiplexed encryption. These extensions are under review by the
                maintainers of JWE/JWT and are likely to be mainstreamed eventually.</p>

            <p>All JSON messages in this protocol are part of a "message family" named <code>relmgmt</code>. This
            family is identified by the following DID
                reference (a form of URI [TODO: hyperlink to def of DID reference in DID spec]):</p>

            <pre>did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/relmgmt/1.0</pre>

            <p>Of course, subsequent evolutions of the message family will replace `1.0` with
                an appropriate update per <a target="_blank" href="https://semver.org">semver</a> rules.</p>

                <h4>Delete (Revoke)</h4>
                <p>Deleting or revoking a verification key is not to be confused with temporary suspension or rotation. Deletion
                    sets an identity's verification key to null; this permanently terminates the identity's ability to operate
                    on the network because there is no key that the identity can use to authenticate itself--even to submit a
                    new key rotation request. It is irreversible.</p>
                 <p>Revocation may be appropriate
                    when a person dies or a business is legally dissolved. It does not remove any record or history of the
                    identity--it simply prevents any new history from accruing. This guarantees that
                    no malicious actor can recover and reactivate an identity that's dead.</p>
                <p>The scope of deletion in peer DIDs is one DID only. This does not prevent an entity from creating new DIDs;
                it simply prevents an entity from reusing the old DID that has been terminated.</p>
                <p> To revoke the document of the DID, the owner of
                    the DID should send a <a
                            href="https://github.com/dhh1128/indy-hipe/blob/relationship-protocol/text/peer-relationship-protocol/README.md#query_view">leave_us

                <p>
                This message is used to announce that a party is abandoning the relationship. In a self-sovereign
                paradigm, abandoning a relationship can be done unilaterally, and does not require formal
                announcement. Indeed, sometimes a formal announcement is impossible, if one of the parties
                    is offline. So while using this message is encouraged and best practice, it is not mandatory.</p>

                <p>If Bob receives a message like this, he should assume that Alice no longer considers
                herself part of "us", and take appropriate action. This could include destroying
                data about Alice that he has accumulated over the course of their relationship,
                removing her peer DID and its public key(s) and endpoints from his wallet, and so
                forth. The nature of the relationship, the need for a historical audit trail, regulatory
                requirements, and many other factors may influence what's appropriate; the protocol
                    simply requires that the message be understood to have permanent termination semantics.</p>

                <p>If `ack_requested` is `true`, then it is best practice for Bob to send a `my_view`
                message with Alice's DID removed from the `you` field. This acknowledges that she is
                no longer in the relationship from his perspective. This will make more sense
                when the `my_view` message is described, later on--but here's what such a `my_view`
                    message would look like if Alice and Bob were in a pairwise relationship:</p>

            <h3>Cooperative Synchronization</h3>

            <p>The significance of the error situation described above, where Alice attempts a key
            rotation that Bob must reject, is greater than might casually be assumed.
            We tend to think of Alice and Bob as monolithic entities--but in fact, each may have
            multiple agents that they use inside their respective sovereign domains. Ideally,
            all of Alice's agents would share a coherent, perfectly synchronized view of the Alice:Bob
                relationship, all the time. But the real world is messier.</p>

            <p>One way this is true is in highly complex sovereign domains of institutions. An enterprise
            might control dozens of rich agents running as daemons on its servers--and maybe hundreds
            or thousands of static agents embodied in cron jobs, web hooks, and other forms of
            automation. (For a discussion about "rich" and "static" agents, see <a target="_blank"
            href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ExQM_suu9MISrPanpK9sBGqVZFxf8pp4GvytcsKbkVM/edit#slide=id.g445a9ada60_0_21">
                    Agent Taxonomy</a>.)</p>

            <p>Achieving robust synchronization in such a world is nearly impossible--especially with
            low latency. In particular, static agents might not participate in any kind of sophisticated
            intra-domain synchronization, because they are so simple and their state engines are so
            primitive. This could lead to them having their authorization cancelled without
            notification from internal sources. If so, they should get a `problem_report` from Alice
                when they attempt to exercise privileges in the Alice:Bob relationship.</p>

            <p>This challenge with imperfect propagation of relationship state also manifests in
            the agents of an ordinary consumer. Suppose Alice owns a phone and a tablet. She
            temporarily misplaces the phone, so she sends Bob a message with her tablet, removing
            the phone's keys from the list of authorized keys. If Alice later finds the phone and
            tries to use it to send Bob a message, she should get a `problem_report` message as
                described above, explaining that this operation looks invalid from Bob's perspective.</p>

            <p>Both of these examples show that the responsibility for communicating about the state
            of a relationship is not easily partitioned. Bob should do what he can to tell his
            agents about any changes he makes, *and also* about any changes that Alice makes.
            And he should be helpful about informing Alice's agents if he knows more about the
            relationship state than they do. Alice should do the same. If both engage in cooperative
            synchronization, then the overall knowledge about relationship state may not be
                perfect, but it will be good enough to function robustly.</p>

            <p>The `query_view` and `my_view` messages help, here. If an agent receives a `problem_report`
            announcing that it is out-of-date on its view of relationship state, the agent can follow
            up with a `query_view` to see what state it lacks. Bob's static agent may be able to discover
            and plug the gap by talking to Alice, even if Bob hasn't been able to update his own static
                agent directly.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>Split Brain</h4>

            <p>If an agent rotates its keys in Bob's domain and then sends an announcement of that change
            to Alice, only to have Alice reject it because the agent's view of state is stale [TODO:
            go back and add in something in `update_us` that ties the update to a merkle root, such that
            we can detect staleness even if the agent is still authorized...], then we have a problem:
            the agent's old key might have been authorized, but the new one is not. And the agent has
            thrown away the old key. This phenomenon of having independent actors evolve in parallel in
                incompatible ways is called "the split brain problem" in database theory.</p>

            <p>To avoid this problem, agents should not fully commit a key rotation on their side until
                receiving an acknowledgement from the other side of the relationship.</p>

            <p>Note that split brain can still happen, despite an agent's best efforts to delay the commit,
            if the agent on the other side doesn't deliver a `problem-report` as described above. And even
            if it does, there is still a corner case where split brain can occur, because Bob's stale
            agent's proposed change might be acknowledged by one of Alice's agents that, itself, has a
            stale view of the relationship. Therefore, a `problem-report` about the staleness is sendable
            at any point when the the split brain is detected. [TODO: describe algorithm to undo split brain
                if detected.]</p>
