<h2>Core Characteristics</h2>

<section class="normative">
    <h3>Namestring</h3>

    <p>The namestring that identifies this DID method SHALL be: <code>peer</code></p>
    <p>A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix: <code>did:peer:</code>.
        Per the DID specification, this string MUST be in lowercase. The remainder of the DID, after the prefix,
        is the <a href="#namespace-specific-identifier-nsi">namespace specific identifier described below</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="note">Early feedback on this method suggested that we embed it beneath the namespace of a particular
        blockchain, as in <code>did:sov:peer</code> or <code>did:v1:nym</code>.
        However, this DID method is not captive to any particular blockchain, does not take its resolution rules
        from a parent method, and does not require anchoring or reference to a blockchain to be valid.
        Furthermore, any direct or indirect anchoring of a peer DID to a specific blockchain is driven by
        circumstance and changeable at any time. For example, a peer DID could specify that it is using
        a dead drop on blockchain 1, then change to blockchain 2, then change to blockchains 3 and 4 at
        the same time. Therefore, "peer" belongs at the top of the DID namespace. How this method may be
        used with various blockchains is discussed <a href="#grafting">later</a>.
    </p>

<section class="normative">
    <h3>Target System(s)</h3>

    <p>This DID method applies to any identity management implementation that meets the following two
        requirements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Generation Algorithm</em> &mdash; The DIDs are created using the <a href="#namespace-specific-identifier-nsi">
            algorithm described below</a>, endowing them with properties vital to trust between peers that is not
            dependent on a central source of truth.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Protocol</em> &mdash; The metadata for DIDs (what would be stored in an on-chain DID doc in other methods)
            is communicated and maintained as described in the <a href="#protocols">Protocols</a> section.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="normative">
    <h3>Namespace Specific Identifier (NSI)</h3>

    <p>The peer DID scheme is defined by the following ABNF (see [[RFC5234]] for syntax):</p>
    <pre class="example" class="ABNF" title="ABNF for peer DIDs">
peer-did = "did:peer:" numalgo encalgo "-" numbasis
numalgo = "1"
encalgo = "1"
numbasis = 64*hex
    </pre>
    <p>The meaning of <code>hex</code> is the traditional one for hexadecimal digits.</p>
    <p>Peer DIDs use an underlying number with high entropy, called the <dfn>numeric basis</dfn>, as the source of their
        uniqueness. This version of the spec requires a 256-bit numeric basis generated from a hash
        of the initial content of a DID doc. The <a href="#namestring-generation-method">next section</a> has details.
        The requirement about size and origin of numeric basis is represented in the DID value with <code>numalgo
        </code> == <code>1</code>. Subsequent versions of the spec may describe additional methods of generating the
        numeric basis; each new method is associated with the next unused <code>numalgo</code> digit as it is defined.
    </p>
    <p>This <em>numeric basis</em> is transformed to text using an encoding algorithm. This version of the spec encodes
        using 64 hexadecimal digits, and represents that choice in the DID value with <code>encalgo</code> == <code>1
        </code>. Subsequent versions of the spec may describe additional encodings; each new encoding is associated with
        the next unused <code>encalgo</code> digit as it is defined.</p>
    <p class="note">Implementations of <code>encalgo</code> == <code>1</code> SHOULD render the numeric basis in lower
        case. However, the <code>numbasis</code> portion of peer DIDs MUST be compared according to
        whatever case-sensitivity is implied by the encoding algorithm they use. Hex is not case-sensitive,
        so two peer DID strings using <code>encalgo</code> == <code>1</code>, that differ only in
        the <code>numbasis</code> portion, are equivalent. If a future version of the spec
        defines <code>encalgo</code> == <code>2</code> to be something case-sensitive, such as <a target="_blank"
        href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding">base58</a> or base64 [[RFC4648]], comparison of
        the <code>numbasis</code> values for peer DIDs with <code>encalgo</code> == <code>2</code> will be
        case-sensitive. Therefore, routines that handle peer DIDs MUST NOT normalize or ignore case unless they
        take into account the encoding algorithm of each individual peer DID.</p>
</section>

<section class="normative">
    <h3>Namestring Generation Method</h3>

    <p>The unique <em>numeric basis</em> underlying a Peer DID MUST be generated as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a <dfn>genesis version</dfn> of JSON text of the DID doc for the DID. The genesis version MUST
            include enough keys and <a target="#authorization">authorization</a> that the genesis version of the doc
            can be signed, to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks during initial DID exchange. It SHOULD also include
            enough state that subsequent evolutions to the doc are authorized; otherwise, the doc is a dead end.
            It MUST NOT include the DID itself (either the root <code>id</code> property or its value). This
            lets the doc be created without knowing the DID's value in advance.
            Suppressing the DID value creates a <dfn>stored variant</dfn> of peer DID doc data,
            as opposed to the <dfn>resolved variant</dfn> that would have an actual DID value in the root <code>id
            </code> property. (In either the stored or resolved variant of the doc, anywhere else that the DID value
            would appear, it should appear as a relative reference rather than an absolute value. For example, each
            <code>controller</code> property of a <a href="#publickey">publicKey that is owned by this DID would say
                <code>"controller": "#id"</code></a>.)
        </li>
        <li>Calculate the SHA256 [[!RFC4634]] hash of the bytes of the <a>stored variant</a> of the <a>genesis
            version</a> of the DID doc, and make this value the new DID's <a>numeric basis</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>By basing the numeric value of the DID on the <a>genesis version</a> of the DID doc, the DID can begin its
        lifecycle with any number of keys and endpoints, and when the doc is signed or auth-encrypted by one
        of the keys, the recipient can know it has not been modified since creation. This guarantees the
        initial integrity of the DID's chain of custody.</p>
    <p>By hashing the stored variant, we avoid the circular problem of including the DID in the data that's being
        hashed. This means that a peer DID doc must be resolved by converting a <a>stored variant</a> of DID doc
        data into a <a>resolved variant</a> by inserting the value of the DID being resolved, during resolution.</p>

<section class="informative">
    <h3>Recognizing and handling peer DIDs</h3>

    <p>A valid <code>peer</code> DID might be:</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A typical peer DID" id="typical-did">
did:peer:11-479cbc07c3f991725836a3aa2a581ca2029198aa420b9d99bc0e131d9f3e2cbe
    </pre>

    <p>Peer DIDs consist entirely of printable ASCII characters and are exactly 76 characters long. They have no
        whitespace, and the only punctuation they use are the characters <code>:</code> and <code>-</code>. When
        rendering in columns with a constrained width, they could be hyphenated one or more times as needed, at any
        position after offset 14 (the 2nd hex character); the hyphens would not be confused with meaningful delimiters,
        and the final character of the DID would be easy to find. They could also be rendered in a short form with the
        middle of the long hex section elided, if it is not necessary to compare them with precision: <code>
        did:peer:11-479cbc0...f3e2cbe</code>. The ellipsis should not obscure the prefix or the initial or final few
        characters of the hex, to preserve enough info for casual distinction. This might be a useful rendering in log
        files, for example.
    </p>

    <p>A convenient regex to match <code>peer</code> DIDs is:</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Matching regex" id="matching-regex">
^did:peer:(1)(1)-([a-fA-F0-9]{64})$
    </pre>

    <p>A match against this regex places <code>numalgo</code> (the algorithm for choosing a numeric basis) in
        capture group 1, <code>encalgo</code> (the algorithm for encoding) in capture group 2, and the numeric
        basis itself, in properly encoded form, in capture group 3.</p>

    <p>Javascript to sort two peer DIDs or test them for equality might be:</p>

    <pre class="example" title="JavaScript to compare two peer DIDs" id="js-compare-func">
function comparePeerDIDs(didA, didB) {
    a = didA.substring(0,12);
    b = didB.substring(0,12);
    // Compare the prefix case-sensitively.
    n = (a < b) ? -1 : (a > b ? 1 : 0);
    if (n == 0) {
        // Don't use .localeCompare() or .toLocaleLowerCase();
        // we want raw ASCII comparison. Just normalize to
        // lower case before comparing.
        a = didA.substring(12).toLowerCase();
        b = didB.substring(12).toLowerCase();
        n = (a < b) ? -1 : (a > b ? 1 : 0);
    }
    return n;
}
    </pre>

    <p>See also the <a href="compare.py">Python equivalent</a>. Note that more robust and efficient versons of this code
        could be written; this merely illustrates a correct algorithm.</p>

    <h3>Reserved Values</h3>
    
    <p>The sixteen peer DID values that have 64 identical hex digits (all 0s, all 1s, all 2s, etc) are reserved for
        testing, debugging, and other meta purposes. They cannot be resolved in a normal and valid way, since we haven't
        done the massive amount of computation that would tell us what DID Doc content would produce the associated numeric
        bases. Instead, they MAY trigger the special handling described below, beginning in implementations that offer
        <a>Level 2a</a> or <a>Level 2b</a> support</a> for this spec. Implementations SHOULD NOT define semantics that
        contradict these.

        <dd><p>This DID is somewhat like <code>/dev/null</code>; it is a predefined identity that acts as a sink, accepting

        <dt>The <dfn>anywise self DID</dfn> (did:peer:11-1111...1111)</dt>
        <dd><p>
            This DID is somewhat analogous to the use of "loopback" or "localhost" in TCP/IP; it means an anywise or
            public "self" for whatever entity sees it in a DIDComm stack. An agent that emits a message for this DID
            should see the message come back to itself without passing through any mediators or relays, with no trust
            degradation in its <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0029-message-trust-contexts/README.md"
            target="aries">message trust context</a> and with minimal latency. Protocols that depend on cooperation from
            another party should always get maxiumum cooperation from this one; for example, an invitation to connect
            that arrives at this DID should always be accepted <code>:-)</code> &mdash; though negotiation of a new
            pairwise DID should ensue. Attempts to resolve this DID should return a DID Doc that contains the same set
            of keys as the <a>bitbucket DID</a>. This makes it a flexible, low-risk identity to connect with or talk to
