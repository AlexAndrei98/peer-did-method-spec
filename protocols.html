<h2>Protocols</h2>
<section class="informative">
    <h3>Roles and Agents</h3>

    <p>As described in the introduction, we call this the "peer" DID method because it enables peers to exchange
        DIDs without recourse to a central authority. Thus, we expect all participants in the protocol to play the
        same <code>peer</code> role, and to operate by exactly the same rules. And this is the case, at a high
        level.
    </p>

    <p>However, at another level of detail, each peer may interact through various pieces of software and hardware that
        proxy them. They may need to reveal a modest amount of information about such <a target="aries"
        href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0004-agents/README.md">agents</a> to
        achieve cooperative security. For example, Alice may control three devices and may wish to protect
        herself from hacking by saying that at least two of her existing devices must agree before a new device can be
        added or an existing device can be revoked. This requires her to share her M-of-N <a href="#authorization">
        authorization policy</a> with Bob, with enough information about agent keys that he can validate a multi-party
        digital signature. Thus, our protocol must occasionally contemplate details about this more granular level
        of each peer's <a>sovereign domain</a>.

    <h3>Messages</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Peers interact via messages.</dt>
        <dd>This is a more general claim than saying that peers expose an API because it doesn't assume that peers
            are directly callable by each other. It must be possible to exchange DIDs in this method in a very
            asynchronous fashion (e.g., one party sends a message while the other party is offline; a response is
            returned when the original sender may not be actively listening).
        </dd>
        <dt>Message transmission is transport-agnostic.</dt>
        <dd>That is, the messages can flow over any combination of HTTP, Bluetooth, NFC, email, AMPRNet (TCP/IP over
            ham radio), snail mail, sneakernet, intermediaries, or future protocols we have not yet imagined.
        </dd>
        <dt>Messages are JSON ([[RFC8259]]).</dt>
        <dd>They are compatible with <a target="jsonld" href="https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#basic-concepts">
            basic concepts of [[JSON-LD]]</a>, but <a target="aries"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0047-json-ld-compatibility/README.md">
            no deep knowledge of JSON-LD is required to understand them, and no dependency
            on JSON-LD libraries is necessary</a>. The specifics of the JSON format are discussed below.
        </dd>
        <dt>Messages are serialized and encrypted in a standard way for transport.</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>This method associates security guarantees with the message envelope rather than the transport, and is
                aligned philosophically with the approach of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/"
                        target="rfc">IETF's Message Level Security initiative</a>. However, the first version of this spec
                predates MLS's maturity, so the wire format uses JWEs ([[RFC7516]]) with
                <a href="https://github.com/openssi/peer-did-method-spec/issues/14#issuecomment-493626810"
                        target="_blank">some extensions</a>, instead. The extensions allow the same message to be
                encrypted once for multiple recipients and sent to them all in an efficient manner:

            <p>These extensions are under review by the maintainers of JWE/JWT and are likely to be mainstreamed
                eventually. The particulars are detailed in <a target="aries"

    <h3>CRUD Operations</h3>
    <section>
        <h4>Create (Register)</h4>
        <p>Although the work of <em>creating</em> a peer DID and the <a>genesis version</a> of its DID Doc can be
            done at any time and does not require a message, <em>registering</em> a peer DID with the other party or
            parties in a relationship involves a specific sequence of messages known as the <dfn>DID Exchange
            protocol</dfn>. The protocol is <a target="aries"
            href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0023-did-exchange/README.md">
            formally documented in Aries RFC 0023</a>; only a summary is offered here. It has 3 steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>One of the parties (the <dfn>inviter</dfn>) sends an <dfn>invitation</dfn> to connect. The
                invitation is NOT encrypted, and it does NOT require the recipient (the <dfn>invitee</dfn>) to
                have special software that understands this protocol. Instead, it is a specially formatted URI
                that can be a <a target="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_deep_linking">
                deferred deep link</a>, helping the invitee to learn about SSI, get an SSI-capable app, and
                otherwise onboard into the ecosystem. If the invitee already has SSI-aware software, the URI
                can be recognized by a registered handler, short-circuiting the URI fetch and the onboarding/
                learning process. This invitation URI may be transmitted by email, SMS, QR code, or any other
                convenient method. If it is important to the inviter that it be secured, the inviter can share
                the invitation on a secure channel.
            </li>
            <li>The invitee sends an encrypted <dfn>connection request</dfn> back to the inviter, using the
                endpoint that the inviter supplied in the invitation. This connection request includes a signed
                version of the <a>resolved variant</a> [TODO: signed variant??] of the <a>genesis version</a> of
                the invitee's DID Doc.
            </li>
            <li>The inviter sends an encrypted <dfn>connection response</dfn> the other direction. This response
                includes a signed version of the <a>resolved variant</a> of the <a>genesis version</a> of the
                inviter's DID Doc.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>These three steps have been carefully defined to achieve a number of important goals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Because the invitation can be sent to someone who does not know about DIDs or SSI at all,
                and because it can be sent over insecure channels, establishing DID relationships has an
                extremely low bar. This is vital to the virality of SSI.
            </li>
            <li>The invitation identifies an endpoint over which the connection can occur, but it does not
                communicate peer keys or a peer DID from the inviter, and the endpoint that the inviter uses (as
                well as the inviter's DID and keys) are only transmitted once security and privacy are guaranteed.
            </li>
            <li>The protocol can be used by parties using any DID method. One of the parties can be using
                a peer DID, both can, or neither can.
            </li>
            <li>The invitation can be sent by a third party, allow introductions (Alice introduces Carol to Bob).
                However, an introducer is prevented from seeing the secure and private connection built by the
                two parties.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additional security against man-in-the-middle attacks may be achieved by signing an invitation, if it is
            public. If the public invitation includes an <a>anywise</a> DID, then the invitee should verify that the
            signature on the invitation matches with an active verification key for the associated anywise DID. If the
            public invitation includes a verification key, then the invitee can verify that the signature on the
            invitation matches with the verification key. Once the DIDs are exchanged, the invitee can
            ask the inviter for proof-of-control of that initial verification key. In any case, further action is
            advisable to build deeper trust about the identity of other side. This likely includes mutual exchange
            of <a target="vcspec" href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials</a>.

        <p>This message does not follow a simple request~response pattern, and does not have "update" in its name,
            because either party may know details that the other party lacks. This is especially likely when some
            agents of either party have been offline. The sender picks a point in time, <code>delta_time</code>,
            where it believes it and the receiver were probably in sync; it then describes the <a>deltas</a>
            that it knows about, that have happened since.
        </p>
        <p>If the recipient already has the same state, it replies with an <a target="aries"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0015-acks/README.md">ACK</a>.
        </p>
        <p>If the recipient knew about a subset of the delta, but not all of it, it applies what is left of the
            delta, and sends an ACK.
        </p>
        <p>If the recipient has a more evolved state, the recipient sends a reply that is a new <code>sync_state
        </code> message informing the sender of hitherto unknown information. As with the ACKs, this new message is
            known to be a reply to the original <code>sync_state</code> because its <a target="aries"
                    href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0008-message-id-and-threading#threaded-messages">
                <code>~thread</code> decorator identifies the previous message's <code>@id</code> as its
                <code>thid</code></a>.
        </p>
        <p>If the recipient does not recognize the base_hash, it selects a hash from a point in time earlier than
            <code>base_hash_time</code> and sends back a new <code>sync_state</code> message with that earlier base.
        </p>
        <p>Because of the nature of our <a href="#crdt-rules">CRDT rules</a>, truly
            problematic merge conflicts cannot occur. All objects in the DID doc that
            have an <code>id</code> property are immutable, and ordering of operations does not
            need to be highly consistent. Furthermore, an object in both deleted and
            undeleted state must be deemed to be deleted. However, if the recipient
            detects a trivial conflict, the delta with the <code>id</code> that sorts smaller/lower
            is selected.</a>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Delete</h4>
        <p>In a self-sovereign paradigm, abandoning a relationship can be done unilaterally, and does not
            require formal announcement; one party can simply stop communicating with the other. Since there
            is no public record of the relationship to delete, no further action is strictly required.
            Indeed, sometimes a formal announcement is impossible, if one of the parties
            is offline.</p>

        <p>However, it is best practice to announce that the relationship is being abandoned. This
            should cause the other party to clean up by removing the DID, DID Doc, and associated metadata from its
            local cache. It should also prevent the other party from trying to communicate in the future.
            Formally terminating a connection happens by sending an <a target="aries"
            href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0030-sync-connection/abandon-connection-protocol#announce"><code>
            announce</code> message</a> to a peer:</p>
        <pre class="example" title="Sample announce message">

  "@type": "did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/abandon_connection/1.0/announce",

  "~please_ack": {}
}
            </pre>
        <p>If Bob receives a message like this, he should assume that Alice no longer considers
            herself connected, and take appropriate action. This could include destroying
            data about Alice that he has accumulated over the course of their relationship,
            removing her peer DID and its public key(s) and endpoints from his wallet, and so
            forth. The nature of the relationship, the need for a historical audit trail, regulatory
            requirements, and many other factors may influence what's appropriate; the protocol
            simply requires that the message be understood to have permanent termination semantics.
        </p>

            <code>~please_ack</code> decorator</a> is optional. It asks the receiver to send an acknowledgement that
            it has processed the message. If used, the receiver should send an ACK that looks like this:</p>
