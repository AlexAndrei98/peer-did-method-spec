<h1>Protocols</h1>

<section class="informative">
    <h2>What is a protocol?</h2>
    <p>Protocols are just formal recipes for stateful interactions. All peers will interact through protocols of one
        type or another. Work on this spec grew out of work on <a target="aries"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0005-didcomm/README.md">DIDComm</a>,
        which is the basis of <a target="aries"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/index.md">many JSON-message-based protocols</a>
        that take advantage of DID-based encryption and privacy. However, using DIDComm is not the only way
        to build a protocol. Therefore, this spec presents a general recipe for creating, reading, updating, and
        deactivating DIDs, and then specifies how that recipe manifests specifically in a DIDComm
        variant. It is possible to be compliant with the spec using a non-DIDComm protocol, too--as long as whatever
        protocol is used is known to both parties and meets the requirements of the general recipe.

<section class="informative">
    <h2>Roles and Agents in Protocols</h2>

    <p>As described in the introduction, we call this the "peer" DID method because it enables peers to exchange
        DIDs without recourse to a central authority. Thus, we expect all participants in the protocol to play the
        same <code>peer</code> role, and to operate by exactly the same rules. And this is the case, at a high
        level.
    </p>

    <p>However, at another level of detail, each peer may interact through various pieces of software and hardware that
        proxy them. They may need to reveal a modest amount of information about such <a target="aries"
        href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0004-agents/README.md">agents</a> to
        achieve cooperative security. For example, Alice may control three devices and may wish to protect
        herself from hacking by saying that at least two of her existing devices must agree before a new device can be
        added or an existing device can be revoked. This requires her to share her M-of-N <a href="#authorization">
        authorization policy</a> with Bob, with enough information about agent keys that he can validate a multi-party
        digital signature. Thus, our protocol must occasionally contemplate details about this more granular level
        of each peer's <a>sovereign domain</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>CRUD Operations</h2>

    <section>
        <h3>Create (Register)</h3>
        <p>Although the work of <em>creating</em> a peer DID and the <a>genesis version</a> of its DID doc can be
            done at any time and does not require communication, <em>registering</em> a peer DID with the other party or
            parties in a relationship requires a specific protocol. This is the only protocol that must be supported
            by an implementation that targets <a>Layer 2a</a> or <a>Layer 2b</a> support.
        </p>
        <section>
            <h4>General Recipe</h4>
            <p>Give the <a>stored variant</a> of a peer DID doc to a remote party in a way that guarantees:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No other party knows the DID values or the content of DID docs (the "confidentiality" guarantee
                    of traditional security analysis).</li>
                <li>Both parties can be sure that they know what the other party intends (the "integrity" guarantee).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A trivial example of a compliant protocol might be for Alice and Bob to use AirDrop to trade DID docs
                between Macbooks when they are standing next to each other -- IFF they are confident that the
                communication channel between them is not hacked. This approach would not work well when the parties
                are remote, because trust would be unachievable. Using HTTPS might be an improvement in that situation,
                if it were done carefully. However, even with HTTPS, there are subtleties to consider. A
                careful study of the DIDComm protocol and its guarantees is recommended when exploring alternatives.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h4>DIDComm Approach</h4>
            <p>Agents that are capable of DIDComm use the <dfn>DID Exchange protocol</dfn> for this task. The protocol is
                <a target="aries"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0023-did-exchange/README.md">
                formally documented in Aries RFC 0023</a>; only a summary is offered here. It has 3 steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>One of the parties (the <dfn>inviter</dfn>) sends an <dfn>invitation</dfn> to connect. The
                    invitation is NOT encrypted, and it does NOT require the recipient (the <dfn>invitee</dfn>) to
                    have special software that understands this protocol. Instead, it is a specially formatted URI
                    that can be a <a target="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_deep_linking">
                    deferred deep link</a>, helping the invitee to learn about SSI, get an SSI-capable app, and
                    otherwise onboard into the ecosystem. If the invitee already has SSI-aware software, the URI
                    can be recognized by a registered handler, short-circuiting the URI fetch and the onboarding/
                    learning process. This invitation URI may be transmitted by email, SMS, QR code, or any other
                    convenient method. If it is important to the inviter that it be secured, the inviter can share
                    the invitation on a secure channel. Important to note that if the messaging is to be done
                    anonymously without sharing of personal identifiable information (PII) between both parties the
                    invitation should not be transmitted to personal email, sms, etc. A one time identifier shall be
                    used to send initial invitation.
                </li>
                <li>The invitee sends an encrypted <dfn>connection request</dfn> back to the inviter, using the
                    endpoint that the inviter supplied in the invitation. This connection request includes a signed
                    version of the <a>resolved variant</a> [TODO: signed variant??] of the <a>genesis version</a> of
                    the invitee's DID doc. The inviter must verify that the received DID was generated according to
                    the <a href="#namestring-generation-method">namestring generation method</a> from the <a>stored variant</a>
                    of the received genesis DID Doc. This is to ensure a strong binding between the received DID and
                    the public key(s) contained in the DID Doc, see also: <a href="#proof-of-control">proof of control</a>.
                </li>
                <li>The inviter sends an encrypted <dfn>connection response</dfn> the other direction. This response
                    includes a signed version of the <a>resolved variant</a> of the <a>genesis version</a> of the
                    inviter's DID doc.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>These three steps have been carefully defined to achieve a number of important goals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Because the invitation can be sent to someone who does not know about DIDs or SSI at all,
                    and because it can be sent over insecure channels, establishing DID relationships has an
                    extremely low bar. This is vital to the virality of SSI.
                </li>
                <li>The invitation identifies an endpoint over which the connection can occur, but it does not
                    communicate peer keys or a peer DID from the inviter, and the endpoint that the inviter uses (as
                    well as the inviter's DID and keys) are only transmitted once security and privacy are guaranteed.
                </li>
                <li>The protocol can be used by parties using any DID method. One of the parties can be using
                    a peer DID, both can, or neither can.
                </li>
                <li>The invitation can be sent by a third party, allow introductions (Alice introduces Carol to Bob).
                    However, an introducer is prevented from seeing the secure and private connection built by the
                    two parties.
                </li>
                <li>It is possible to conduct the protocol very asynchronously. Either party can be offline when the
                other party sends a message; no server has to be listening in realtime to make it work. Invitations and
                    subsequent steps can be widely separated in time, and can use different transports.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additional security against man-in-the-middle attacks may be achieved by signing an invitation, if it is
                public. If the public invitation includes an <a>anywise</a> DID, then the invitee should verify that the
                signature on the invitation matches with an active verification key for the associated anywise DID. If the
                public invitation includes a verification key, then the invitee can verify that the signature on the
                invitation matches with the verification key. Once the DIDs are exchanged, the invitee can
                ask the inviter for proof-of-control of that initial verification key. In any case, further action is
                advisable to build deeper trust about the identity of other side. This likely includes mutual exchange
                of <a target="vcspec" href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials</a>.

    <section>
        <h3>Read (Resolve)</h3>
        <p>With peer DIDs, resolution can be local or remote, and it can be resolution of <em>either</em> one's own peer
            DID, or of a peer DID from a remote party. Local resolution of any DID--one's own or another's--is often
            a simple matter of looking up a DID doc in a local cache. This lookup is internal and can be done any way
            an implementation chooses. No protocol is required, and this spec has no opinion about how it should work.
            However, when resolution involves a remote party (either one's own agent or the agent of a peer), a protocol
            is involved.
        </p>
        <p class="note">Because peer DIDs are supposed to be resolvable ONLY by peers, resolution requests in this method
            MUST NOT be honored if they do not come from peers. Furthermore, reasoning about the correctness of a response
            is only possible if the genesis version of a peer DID doc is known to the requester. Implementations SHOULD
            NOT return a resolved DID doc to a party that does not possess a copy of the genesis DID doc, or some
            legitmate derivation thereof. To do otherwise would be to ask the <code>requester</code> to trust the
            <code>responder</code> in a way that dilutes the goals of the method.
        </p>

        <section>
            <h4>General Recipe</h4>
            <p>A <code>requester</code> should formally ask a remote party for the DID doc--perhaps a specific version
                or timestamp thereof--that corresponds to a particular DID. A <code>responder</code> should reply with
                compatible data, in a way that guarantees confidentiality and integrity, plus:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <code>responder</code> can tell that the <code>requester</code> is an authorized peer.</li>
                <li>It can be proved that the state in the response is derived from the genesis version of the DID doc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A trivial example of this recipe might be for Alice and Bob to perform mutual (NOT one-way) authentication
                over HTTPS, and then to engage in a web service-based interaction that produces the resolved doc. This
                approach is susceptible to MITM eavesdropping such as the ones used by SSL visibility appliances

                </a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.f5.com/solutions/application-security/ssl-visibility">F5</a>.
                It should therefore be used with careful consideration of the required <a target="aries"

            <p>The DIDComm variant of this recipe is documented in greater detail in

                        target="aries">Aries RFC 0124</a>. Here, we offer only a summary.
            </p>
            <p>A peer DID can be resolved to a DID document by sending a <a target="aries"

    <section>
        <h3 id="sync-protocol">Update</h3>
        <p>The subject of a peer DID can update their associated DID document with anyone who knows the DID&mdash;one or more
            agents of the peer(s), or agents of the owner. This operation is more important in the peer DID method than
            in most other methods, because a loose collection of decentralized peers may include many different views
            of current state, caused by inconsistent and incomplete connectivity within the peer group.
        </p>
        <section>
            <h4>General Recipe</h4>
            <p>As with other operations, update must cause data to flow in a way that provides confidentiality and
                integrity. In addition, the protocol must guarantee that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Problems with order-of-update and data gaps are solved.</li>
                <li>It is possible to prove the correctness of an update, even if it is reported by a party of dubious
                    motives.</li>
                <li>Eventual consistency is achievable.</li>
                <li>The protocol can tolerate imperfectly or inconsistently connected participants. Some agents may
                not be able to participate in synchronization at any given point in time--or ever.</li>
                <li>Alice cannot assume that Bob's agents are centralized (communicate through a central clearinghouse;
                all share a common view), and vice-versa. Alice can assume this about her <em>own</em> agents
                if she likes, but requiring such a strategy of the other partner is not safe or reasonable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These requirements are very demanding. An approach that fails to satisfy the final requirement is
                easy to imagine, though. Each side maintains a server that knows their own definitive state. Whenever
                Alice changes her state, she makes sure that her state is known to her server. Bob does corresponding work
                on his side. Whenever Alice gets a state update from Bob, she assumes that all of Bob's agents agree;
                whenever she wants to notify Bob that her state has updated, she tells Bob's server, and depends on it to
                pass the word along inside Bob's domain.
            </p>
            <p>Such an approach does not conform to this spec, because it requires that both identity owners, not just
                the one running a particular implementation, centralize the management of their identity domains. It
                also requires that servers be online and reachable during any DID doc updates by either party. This may
                be a perfectly reasonable choice for any given identity owner, but it is not reasonable to impose on a
                remote other.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h4>DIDComm Approach</h4>
            <p>The DIDComm approach implements these protocol requirements by trading <a target="aries"

            sync_state</a> messages with one or more peers. These messages can be sent in a very deliberate fashion,
            but also in a more casual, gossip style. In addition, any other DIDComm messages exchanged between peers can
            be decorated with `~state`, allowing checks to see whether a sync is needed. The details of `sync_state`
            usage are documented in <a target="aries"
            href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0030-sync-connection/README.md">Aries

            <p>This message does not follow a simple request~response pattern, and does not have "update" in its name,
                because either party may know details that the other party lacks. This is especially likely when some
                agents of either party have been offline. The sender picks a point in time, <code>delta_time</code>,
                where it believes it and the receiver were probably in sync; it then describes the <a>deltas</a>

            <p>If the recipient already has the same state, it replies with an <a target="aries"
                    href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0015-acks/README.md">ACK</a>.
            </p>
            <p>If the recipient knew about a subset of the delta, but not all of it, it applies what is left of the
                delta, and sends an ACK.
            </p>
            <p>If the recipient has a more evolved state, the recipient sends a reply that is a new <code>sync_state
            </code> message informing the sender of hitherto unknown information. As with the ACKs, this new message is
                known to be a reply to the original <code>sync_state</code> because its <a target="aries"
                        href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0008-message-id-and-threading#threaded-messages">
                    <code>~thread</code> decorator identifies the previous message's <code>@id</code> as its
                    <code>thid</code></a>.
            </p>
            <p>If the recipient does not recognize the base_hash, it selects a hash from a point in time earlier than
                <code>base_hash_time</code> and sends back a new <code>sync_state</code> message with that earlier base.
            </p>
            <p>Because of the nature of our <a href="#crdt-rules">CRDT rules</a>, truly
                problematic merge conflicts cannot occur. All objects in the DID doc that
                have an <code>id</code> property are immutable, and ordering of operations does not
                need to be highly consistent. Furthermore, an object in both deleted and
                undeleted state must be deemed to be deleted. However, if the recipient
                detects a trivial conflict, the delta with the <code>id</code> that sorts smaller/lower
                is selected.</a>.

        <h3>Deactivate</h3>
        <p>In a self-sovereign paradigm, abandoning a relationship can be done unilaterally, and does not
            require formal announcement; one party can simply stop communicating with the other. Since there
            is no public record of the relationship to delete, no further action is strictly required.
            Indeed, sometimes a formal announcement is impossible, if one of the parties
            is offline.</p>

        <p>However, it is best practice to announce that the relationship is being abandoned. This
            should cause the other party to clean up by removing the DID, DID doc, and associated metadata from its
            local cache. It should also prevent the other party from trying to communicate in the future.
        </p>
        <section>
            <h4>General Recipe</h4>
            <p>Send a message or make an API call announcing that the relationship is over. Possibly, receive an
                acknowledgement in response.</p>

            <h4>DIDComm Approach</h4>
            <p>Formally terminating a connection happens by sending an <a target="aries"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0030-sync-connection/abandon-connection-protocol#announce"><code>
                announce</code> message</a> to a peer:</p>
            <pre class="example" title="Sample announce message">
{
  "@type": "did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/abandon_connection/1.0/announce",
  "@id": "c17147d2-ada6-4d3c-a489-dc1e1bf778ab",

            <p>If Bob receives a message like this, he should assume that Alice no longer considers
                herself connected, and take appropriate action. This could include destroying
                data about Alice that he has accumulated over the course of their relationship,
                removing her peer DID and its public key(s) and endpoints from his wallet, and so
                forth. The nature of the relationship, the need for a historical audit trail, regulatory
                requirements, and many other factors may influence what's appropriate; the protocol
                simply requires that the message be understood to have permanent termination semantics.

                <code>~please_ack</code> decorator</a> is optional. It asks the receiver to send an acknowledgement that
                it has processed the message. If used, the receiver should send an ACK that looks like this:</p>
