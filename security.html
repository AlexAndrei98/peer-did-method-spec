<h2>Security Considerations</h2>
<section>
    <h3>Secure communication</h3>
    <p>All the messages in this protocol (except for a connection invitation that requires no security, by design)
        must be sent encrypted, using the encryption format specified in <a target="aries"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0019-encryption-envelope/README.md">
            DIDComm's encryption envelope</a>. This gives strong guarantees about the confidentiality and integrity of
        exchanged data, regardless of the transport mechanism used to transmit the messages.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Proof of Control</h3>
    <p>Because peer DIDs are generated from an <a href="#namestring-generation-method">algorithm</a> that includes the values of their initial public key(s)
        as input, they cannot be created without the creator controlling them. As mentioned earlier, this prevents
        man-in-the-middle attacks at the time of creation. A man-in-the-middle attacker might still try to exchange 
		the public key(s) in a DID Doc, while keeping the DID the same. If unnoticed, this would bind a DID generated
		by an honest party to the attacker's public key(s). To prevent this, the receiver of a freshly generated peer
		DID and DID Doc must verify that the DID was properly generated using the <a href="#namestring-generation-method">algorithm</a>.
		This check is required when the received (DID, DID Doc) pair was not otherwise authenticated, which is the case
		for the exchange request during <a href="#create-register">peer DID Exchange</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Entropy</h3>
    <p>
        Since keys must be created from keys generated by a secure random number generator, they are guaranteed
        to be unpredictable and globally unique at creation time.</p>

    <h3>Key Management</h3>
    <p>Keys used to control peer DIDs, or keys authorized to communicate and update the DID docs
        for peer DIDs, should be managed according to best practices for DKMS, as described in
        <a target="aries" href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0051-dkms/dkms-v4.md">
        the DKMS spec</a>. See the <a href="#static-and-key-rotation">note about key rotation and static-DID-only
        support</a> in the <a href="#impl">Implementation section</a>.
    </p>
    <p><a target="sgl" href="https://evernym.github.io/sgl/docs/reference.html#rules">SGL rules</a> are powerful and
        flexible, and should be used to implement best practices.</p>
