<h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>
<p>Peer DIDs should remain <a>pairwise</a> or <a>n-wise</a>, not be reused across relationships. This
    allows proper isolation to defeat correlation. It also enables granular exercise of sovereignty in a
    robust, <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/evernym/three-dimensions-of-identity-bc06ae4aec1c">
        multidimensional identity</a>.</p>

    <h3>Fingerprinting</h3>
    <p>The names of roles and the arrangement of rules in a peer DID doc could conceivably be used to create
        a sort of fingerprint of a sovereign domain, in much the same way that browser fingerprinting keys off
        individual uniqueness in combinations of browser+plugin+hardware configuration. To combat this problem, the
        following best practices are recommended:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose rules from a standard inventory.</li>
        <li>Choose role names from a standard inventory.</li>
        <li>Only define keys that are relevant to a particular relationship.</li>
        <li>Never reuse <code>id</code>s for keys, rules, or service endpoints across DID docs.</li>
    </ul>
